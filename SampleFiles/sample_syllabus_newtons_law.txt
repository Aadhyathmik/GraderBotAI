Newton's Laws of Motion

Newton's Laws of Motion are three fundamental principles that explain the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws were formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century and have been foundational in classical mechanics, allowing us to understand and predict how objects move in various conditions.

1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: 
   An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. This law explains the concept of inertia â€“ the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion.

2. **Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**: 
   The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This law is often summarized by the equation F = ma, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration. It explains how the force applied to an object and its mass affect its acceleration.

3. **Third Law (Action and Reaction)**: 
   For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that whenever an object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force back on the first. This law is seen in actions such as walking, where pushing against the ground propels a person forward.

These laws form the basis for understanding mechanics and are essential for studying any system involving motion and forces.
